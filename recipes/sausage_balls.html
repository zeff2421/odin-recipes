        <p>These sausage balls are as good as Bisquick® sausage balls, but without the carbs and gluten.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bulk spicy pork sausage</li>
            <li>1 pound shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons coconut flour</li>
            <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages unflavored gelatin</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine sausage, Cheddar cheese, almond flour, coconut flour, gelatin, egg, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix to combine using your hands, a stand mixer, or a food processor. Form mixture into uniformly-sized balls (about 1 1/2-inch diameter) and place on the prepared pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 23 to 28 minutes. Remove sausage balls and let cool on the pan until oil is reabsorbed, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
        </ul>
